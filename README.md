# AI Productivity, Prompt Engineering & Workflow Automation

This repository contains curated materials, frameworks, and practical workflows developed for advanced workshops on **AI-assisted productivity, prompt engineering, and automation systems**.  
The content bridges **theoretical foundations** of large language models with **hands-on, production-ready automation pipelines** using modern AI tools.

---

## 📌 Overview

Modern professionals spend a significant fraction of their time on repetitive cognitive tasks such as email handling, reporting, documentation, and coordination.  
This project demonstrates how **AI systems—when used correctly—can act as force multipliers rather than replacements**, enabling:

- Structured reasoning and drafting
- Workflow automation at scale
- Human-in-the-loop decision making
- Secure and auditable AI usage

The material is designed for **academia, administration, engineering teams, and decision-makers**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand **what AI models are and are not** (capabilities & limitations)
- Master **prompt engineering frameworks** (CRAFT, Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot)
- Design **AI-assisted workflows** instead of one-off prompts
- Build **end-to-end automations** using tools such as:
  - ChatGPT / OpenAI APIs
  - n8n (self-hosted workflow automation)
  - Email, documents, spreadsheets, and APIs
- Apply **verification-first principles** for institutional and professional use

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

### 1. Prompt Engineering (Theory → Practice)
- CRAFT Model: Context, Role, Action, Format, Tone
- Chain-of-Thought prompting for structured reasoning
- Few-shot learning for style and policy consistency
- Iterative refinement as a human–AI collaboration loop

### 2. AI Productivity Systems
- Email triage, summarization, and response drafting
- Meeting preparation and executive summaries
- Report generation and document processing
- Knowledge extraction from unstructured data

### 3. Workflow Automation
- Event-driven pipelines (email, calendar, uploads)
- AI agents embedded inside workflows
- Secure credential handling and error management
- Modular, scalable automation design

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Large Language Models:** ChatGPT / OpenAI
- **Automation Engine:** n8n (node-based, self-hosted)
- **Productivity Stack:** Email, Google Workspace, Excel
- **Research Support:** NotebookLM-style source-grounded analysis
- **Security:** Credential isolation, human verification layers

---

## 🧪 Example Workflows Included

- Daily AI-generated email digest
- Smart email routing and classification
- Automated report generation from spreadsheets
- Document summarization and archival
- Meeting preparation assistant (calendar + research + briefing)

---

## ⚠️ Ethical & Professional Guidelines

> **Golden Rule:**  
> AI drafts. Humans decide.

- AI outputs must always be reviewed
- No confidential or sensitive data should be exposed
- High-stakes decisions remain human responsibilities
- AI is treated as a **junior assistant**, not an authority

---

## 📚 Intended Audience

- University leadership and administrators
- Engineers and technical managers
- Researchers and graduate students
- Professionals seeking scalable productivity systems

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Review the documentation and templates
3. Start with prompt frameworks before automation
4. Build small workflows, then scale
5. Document and iterate
