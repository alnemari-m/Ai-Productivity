# AI Leadership Productivity Workshop
### Using ChatGPT for University Management, Prompt Engineering, and Workflow Automation

This repository contains official materials, templates, and frameworks used in the **AI Leadership Productivity Workshop** delivered at the **University of Tabuk**.  
The workshop focuses on **practical, responsible, and high-impact use of Large Language Models (LLMs)**—specifically ChatGPT—to improve administrative efficiency, communication quality, and decision-support workflows in academic institutions.

---

## 🎯 Workshop Objectives

- Understand what ChatGPT **is and is not**
- Learn how LLMs work at a conceptual level (tokenization, embeddings, attention)
- Master **prompt engineering** using the **CRAFT model**
- Apply **advanced prompting techniques** (Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Iterative Refinement)
- Integrate AI into **real university workflows** safely and effectively
- Establish a **human-in-the-loop** AI usage philosophy for leadership roles

## 🧠 Key Principles

- **AI drafts — humans decide**
- Use AI for **drafting, structuring, and ideation**
- Always **verify**:
  - Financial data
  - Legal language
  - Policy interpretation
  - Confidential or personal information
- Treat ChatGPT as a **junior assistant**, not an authority

---

## 🛠 Included Resources
